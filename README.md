Complications with running the applications

x64 cpu

Only have one version of visual studio to run the program on

Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable (x64) - 14.22.27821

Any other version has to be removed due to the way visual studio initializes using other versions before this one. After only maintaining the single verson there, the application was successfully ran without errors.
